# Twitter Ringleaders

A project to assess the activities of right-wing `culture warriors` on twitter. This repo will contain some basic scripts for interacting with previously scraped twitter data

## Data

Scripts will likely expect input data files to be placed in a `data` directory in the project root. This directory is excluded via the `.gitignore` file to avoid committing sensitive info to a public repo

## Output

Similarly, scripts' output directories will be excluded via `.gitignore` to avoid inadvertently committing data. Making data publicly available is a good thing, but I think that it should be done on your terms - rather than happening automatically. It's better to have a chance to review output to make sure PII isn't getting exposed.
