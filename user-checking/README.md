# User Checking

Even though the API is gone (but also maybe not fully gone) there are still ways to get data from Twitter. It's still a public website that we can browse to. So if we have a list of usernames we can check if they exist, if they're deleted, or if they're suspended.

Aaaaannddd, we may be able to automate this checking

- selenium - a python library to interact with a browser
- phantomJS - a headless virtual browser
